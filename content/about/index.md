Hello. I'm a creative coder and maker based in Sheffield, UK. I enjoy using laser cutters and 3D printers to make gadgets that support my adventures in music and photography. I also write code to present data and generate imagery, and dabble in graphic design.

By day I work at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk), where there is a fantastic student-run maker space called the [iForge](https://iforgesheffield.org/). Most of the things that I have designed and made have been put together there. 

I've set up this site to share what I do, in the hope that it will be useful to someone out there. If you like what I do, you can encourage me to do more of it - and share it here - by buying me a coffee.
