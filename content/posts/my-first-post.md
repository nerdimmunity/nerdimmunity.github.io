So this is exciting. My first post on this new site. 

I do creative coding and make things using laser cutting and 3D printing. I'm setting up this site to share code and designs. Mostly I'm making things to support my hobbies of music and photography, but I will also post a few projects here that have been done for work at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk), particularly around digital signage and data presentation. I am an enthusiastic user of Sheffield's excellent [iForge](https://iforgesheffield.org/) student-run maker space. 

I hope that someone out there finds this stuff useful. If you do, you can buy me a coffee.
