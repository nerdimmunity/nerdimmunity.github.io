My first post on this new site.\nI do creative coding and make things using laser cutting and 3D printing. I\u0026rsquo;m setting up this site to share code and designs. Mostly I\u0026rsquo;m making things to support my hobbies of music and photography, but I will also post a few projects here that have been done for work at the University of Sheffield, particularly around digital signage and data presentation. I am an enthusiastic user of Sheffield\u0026rsquo;s excellent iForge student-run maker space.\nI hope that someone out there finds this stuff useful.
