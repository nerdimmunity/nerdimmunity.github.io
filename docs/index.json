It is wide enough to take 4-5 pedals and the space under the board takes a power supply to keep everything nice and tidy.\nThe main sections are laser cut from 6mm MDF, with front and back plates in 3mm MDF. The front plate was glued in place, the back plate is a snug fit and is just pressed into the recess at the back so that it can be removed to access to the power supply. I use short cables between pedals and run the extra flex into the unit via the slots on the top.\nI sanded and primed the MDF and then gave it a couple of coats of matt black spray paint. Velcro strips were placed along the top to fix the pedals in place.\nGitHub repository\n","date":"11 July 2023","permalink":"/projects/pedalboard/","section":"Projects","summary":"A simple pedalboard for guitar effects pedals, laser cut from MDF.","title":"Laser cut guitar pedal board"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"music"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2023","permalink":"/","section":"Nerd Immunity","summary":"","title":"Nerd Immunity"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/pedalboard/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"pedalboard"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/project/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"project"},{"content":"This section contains all my current projects.
