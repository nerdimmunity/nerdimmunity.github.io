Strictly this is a symphonie, a simple box-shaped hurdy gurdy with four strings. You turn the handle to move the wheel against the strings, and press the keys to fret the strings. The instrument has two chanter (melody) strings which give chromatic notes over two octaves from G, and two drone strings. It has a hinged lid.\nMy design is an adaptation of various others I found on the internet, but I want to particularly credit the plans for a symphonie by Graeme McCormack which were very helpful. I made a number of short-cuts and simplifications to allow the instrument to be laser cut, and I\u0026rsquo;m sure that his design is a better instrument, so if you have the skills to hand-make a hurdy gurdy (I don\u0026rsquo;t) I suggest you check out his excellent site.\nThe crank was cut from brass using a water jet cutter, and some parts (handle, tuning pegs, axle) were purchased from eBay. I added a number of inlays with Islamic geometric designs cut from acrylic. There are two internal microphones (simple piezo designs which can be glued to the wood) which output to two jacks beneath the tuning pegs. There is a volume knob for each microphone.\nThe wheel was cut from acrylic and then finished on a lathe. The bridge took a bit of time to design, and consists of a floating upper part that rests on two metal rods, each with an adjustable thumbwheel so that fine adjustments to the height of the bridge can be made on each side. The bridges for the drone strings are also adjustable.\nOverall I would say this was a partial success. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t play particularly well and the microphones pick up too much internal noise from the keys. If I was making another one I\u0026rsquo;d have a proper bridge by the tuning pegs and true the wheel on the spindle in situ, rather than trying to do it on a lathe - it\u0026rsquo;s almost impossible to get the wheel evenly pressing against the strings otherwise.\nGo to the GitHub repository\n","date":"22 July 2023","permalink":"/projects/hurdygurdy/","section":"Projects","summary":"A four-string hurdy gurdy laser cut from plywood, brass and acrylic.","title":"Laser cut symphonie (hurdy gurdy)"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"music"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2023","permalink":"/","section":"Nerd Immunity","summary":"","title":"Nerd Immunity"},{"content":"","date":"22 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/project/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"project"},{"content":"This section contains all my current projects.

It is wide enough to take 4-5 pedals and the space under the board takes a power supply to keep everything nice and tidy.\nThe main sections are laser cut from 6mm MDF, with front and back plates in 3mm MDF. The front plate was glued in place, the back plate is a snug fit and is just pressed into the recess at the back so that it can be removed to access to the power supply. I use short cables between pedals and run the extra flex into the unit via the slots on the top.\nI sanded and primed the MDF and then gave it a couple of coats of matt black spray paint. Velcro strips were placed along the top to fix the pedals in place.\nGo to the GitHub repository\n","date":"11 July 2023","permalink":"/projects/pedalboard/","section":"Projects","summary":"A simple pedalboard for guitar effects pedals, laser cut from MDF.","title":"Laser cut guitar pedal board"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/pedalboard/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"pedalboard"},{"content":"","date":"11 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/stompbox/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"stompbox"},{"content":"","date":"7 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/coffee/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"coffee"},{"content":"","date":"7 July 2023","permalink":"/tags/iforge/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"iForge"},{"content":"So this is exciting.
